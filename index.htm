												<h4>Parking modeling & prediction - a queuing approach <a href="#J5"> </a><br><font size="3">(joint with Kameshwar Poolla and Pravin Varaiya)</font> </h4>
									           
									           </div>
											<p> <b>Summary:</b> We propose a queuing model with a non-homogeneous arrival rate and time-varying service time distribution to capture the parking dynamics. We verify all assumptions of
											the model using statistical tests on real data, which provides empirical support for queuing models adopted in
											many theoretical studies. We propose two prediction methods, a microscopic method for short forecast horizon
											(~up to 2 hours), and a macroscopic method for long forecast horizons (~4 to 48 hours). We demonstrate that
											our proposed methods outperform existing model-based and model-free methods proposed in the literature.</em> <br>

											<p> <b>Summary:</b> We develop an estimation algorithm that enables us to estimate queue length at every leg of an intersection only using trace data from connected with penetration rate ~1%. We demosntrate the accuracy of our algorithm using real-world data and compare it to measurements done by physical sensors. Our proposed algorithm provide a novel approach to generate metrics that are neede for performance evaluation, optimization, and real-time operation of urban intersections. In contrast to existing technique to estimate queue length, our algorithm does not require physical harware, provide full coverage of transportaion network, and has negligible costs.   </em> <br>

											<p> <b>Summary:</b> We develop a framework to study hazardous scenarios involving information gaps that routinely occur
in dense urban environments. In particular, we study three groups of scenarios with information gaps: (i) occlusions,
(ii) traffic violations, and (iii) behavior prediction uncertainty. We utilize empirical data to estimate the risk associated with each scenario for AVs. We further analyze the practical value of alternative framework such as Mobileye’s RSS framework (worst-case) and connectivity (V2V and I2V). </em> <br>

											<p> <b>Summary:</b> We study the design of information platforms as an information
											mechanism design problem. We show that a social planner can improve congestion by
											providing either a public imperfect information signal about road conditions, or alternatively, coordinated
											private route suggestions to each driver. We investigate how the structure of the optimal mechanism changes in a dynamic setting where drivers learn from their past experience. We then study competitive environments with for-profit platforms. We show that each platform finds it optimal to fully disclose its information for free. As such, we demonstrate that a competitive environment with multiple platforms can result in increased congestion compared to the outcome under a single information platform or in the absence of any information platforms. </em> <br>

												<h4>A unified approach to dynamic decision-making in multi-agent POMDPs: strategic and non-strategic agents<a href="#J5"> </a><br><font size="3">(joint with Demosthenis Teneketzis, and Ouyang Yi)</font> </h4>
									         
									           </div>
											<p> <b>Summary:</b> In multi-agent Markov decision problems with partial observations (multi-agent POMDPs), there is a circular dependency between agents' strategies and beliefs over time. The analysis of these problems is a challenging task as the computational complexity grows exponentially with the time and the number of agents. We develop a framework addressing these scalability and complexity challenges. We generalize the notion of information state in partially observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDP) to multi-agent POMDPs. Our framework unifies and generalizes various existing results in the literature from both control theory and game theory literature. Our results provide a reduction of (a) dynamic team problems with non-classical information structure to a sequence of static centralized problems, and (b) dynamic games with asymmetric information to a sequence of static games with symmetric information. </em> <br>

												<h4>An asymptotically regret-optimal algorithm for reinforcement learning in POMDPs - a sequential hypothesis testing framework<a href="#J5"> </a><br><font size="3">(joint with Kameshwar Poolla, and Pravin Varaiya)</font> </h4>
									         
									           </div>
											<p> <b>Summary:</b> We develop reinforcement learning algorithms with theoretical regret guarantees for both single-agent and multi-agent POMDPs with an average cost objective. Formulating the problem as a <i>sequential hypothesis testing</i>, we characterize a lower bound on the regret in a singe-agent POMDP. We explicitly quantify the trade-off between exploration and  exploitation, enabling us to design an (asymptotically) regret-optimal algorithm. The algorithm is compromised of a sequence of separate episodes for exploration and exploitation, the length of which are determined adaptively over time to ensure the optimal trade-off between exploration and exploitation. We further generalize our results to multi-agent POMDPs using the transformation framework we developed in [S6,S7]. In particular, to address the coordination issue between agents who have asymmetric partial information, we use the common information among the agents as the coordination device to adjust the length of the exploration and exploitation episodes. </em> <br>

									           </div>
											<p> <b>Summary:</b> Using a queuing model, we investigate the effect of the recently implemented regulations in NewYork City on
											drivers, riders, platforms, and overall society. We show that the minimum wage regulation can result in an increase in the number of drivers, riders, and traffic congestion, while reducing the platform revenue and pickup time. Moreover, imposing a cap on the number of drivers hurts drivers and riders as the platform reaps all the benefits of limiting supply, and results in fewer riders with longer waiting times.</em> <br>

									           </div>
											<p> <b>Summary:</b> Unlike conventional resources in enrgy power systems, information about renewable generation and 
											flexible loads arrives dynamically over time; for instance, the wind
											generation depend on the real-time wind speed. Accordingly, we propose a class of <i>dynamic contracts </i>and <i>dynamic handicapped auctions</i> to procure renewable generation or demand flexibility by an aggregator. The dynamic nature of the mechanisms allow sellers to adjust their position in the market according to new information they individually acquire over time while enabling the aggregator to determine its forward commitment level to serve inflexible demand in advance.</em> <br>

												<h4>Dynamic resource allocation and incentive mechanism for security in networks of interdependent agents <a href="#J5"> </a><br><font size="3">(joint with Farzaneh Farhadi, Jamal Golestani, and Demosthenis Teneketzis)</font> </h4>
									           
									           </div>
											<p> <b>Summary:</b> We study the design of incentive mechanisms to improve security in a network of	interdependent agents. On one hand, the strategic behaviors of agents become more complex in a dynamic setting, as each agent can coordinate its decisions over time. On the other hand, a dynamic setting creates new opportunities for designing incentive mechanisms by exploiting the inter-temporal correlation of observations over time. Exploiting the inter-temporal correlation of agents' observations over time, we construct a set of inference signals about every agent's decision and information. We then construct incentive payments to internalize the effect of each agent on the overall network security level. Accordingly, we propose an incentive mechanism that is socially ecient, incentive compatible, and individually rational for all agents. Our results are in contrast to prior impossibility results which state that such effcient mechanisms do not exist for static settings.</em> <br>
